## Your rights and your choices

You have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in 
this section.

1. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under 
applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the

may permit you to request that we:

- update information which is out of date or incorrect

- delete certain information which we are holding about you

- restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information

We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period

note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in 
some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your 
information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. 
We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity 
before responding to your request.

2. MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

You may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you regarding 
our research, initiatives, or other relevant communications that we believe will 
be interesting to you by contacting us using the information below. If we send you 
marketing email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions 
located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, in accordance with 
applicable law, it may take up to ten (10) days to process your request. Also, note 
that you may not opt out of certain transactional emails from us, such as those 
confirming your requests or providing you with updates regarding our Privacy Policy 
or other terms.

## Third party links and features

Our website may contain links to third-party websites. If you choose to use these 
sites, please note that we are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. 
The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy 
policies of the third-party websites, and not this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read 
the privacy policies of these third parties.

## International users

Because CEP is based in the United States, please note that your information 
may be processed and stored in the United States and other jurisdictions around 
the world where our service providers are located, and that such jurisdictions 
may have different privacy laws than those in your jurisdiction. By using the 
Services, you acknowledge that your information may be processed and stored outside 
of your country of residence.

We may work with external parties including legal counsel, the appropriate regulatory 
authorities, and/or local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints 
regarding our processing of information. You can contact your local data protection 
authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.

## How we protect your information

CEP takes technical and organizational security measures to protect the 
information provided to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, 
disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email 
transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Please keep this in mind 
when disclosing any information to us online.

## Retention of your information

We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which 
it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the 
purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable 
laws. With respect to our research activities, recorded interviews are erased 
bi-annually after research is completed.

## Privacy information for California users

If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with 
additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your “personal 
information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).

### Categories of personal information we collect

Throughout this Notice, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal 
information we collect from and about our users. Under the CCPA, we are also 
required to provide you with the “categories” of personal information we collect. 

The categories we may collect are:

- contact information (such as name and email address)

- internet or other network or device activity (such as operating system and usage 
information)

- geolocation information (e.g., your approximate location based on the temporary 
collection of your IP address)

- other information you choose to provide to us in the course of using the Services

We source, use, and share the categories of personal information we collect from and 
about you consistent with the various business purposes we discuss throughout this Notice.
See the “Information We Collect,” “How We Use Your Information,” “How We 
Share and Disclose Your Information” sections above for more information.
Please note that the CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” 
personal information to third parties. We do not engage in such activity and have not 
engaged in such activity in the past twelve months from the effective date of this 
Privacy Notice.

California law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances 
to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain 
categories of “personal information” (as defined by applicable California law) with 
third parties for their direct marketing purposes. CEP does not share your personal 
information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

## Changes to our Privacy Notice

We review this Privacy Notice with the CEP Steering Council annually. We reserve 
the right to amend this Privacy Notice at any time to reflect changes in the law, 
our data collection and use practices, or advances in technology. We will make the 
revised Privacy Notice accessible on our Services, so you should review the Privacy Notice 
periodically. You can know if the Privacy Notice has changed since the last 
time you reviewed it by checking the “Effective Date” included at the beginning of 
the document. If we make a material change to the Notice, you will be provided with 
appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to use the 
Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version 
of this Privacy Notice.
