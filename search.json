These can be added to your project in a few steps, and configured to reflect how you would like to welcome new contributors and acknowledge their work. These types of tools don‚Äôt completely replace human interaction by maintainers, but can help small teams manage initial triaging and contact with first time contributors.\nYou should discuss which of the below are useful for your project with the core team before they are set up. If you have a useful bot that helps with your contributor experience, please add it to the list below!"

But not only those! ü§Ø They have several areas of contribution, and as their contributions grow in prominence within the project they may very well be recognized as a maintainer, with contributions to code, and social infrastructure - and a focus on project sustainability.\nWhat do we mean by that? The Contributor Experience Lead has 4 areas of activity, and a broad range of skills to achieve results. Let‚Äôs break this down."

The goal of the Contributor Experience Lead is to improve the overall project culture and experience for everyone involved, to promote civility and collaboration, as well as diversity and inclusion. They look for actions they can take themselves, and experiences they can promote in the project as a whole. They are learners and need to adapt to the existing people and culture and build upon it. No two projects are alike.\nIn this guide, we will elaborate about techniques for each area of activity, sharing tools, resources, and experiences. Building systems, and providing examples to motivate how those systems work in practice in different projects."

    "text": "Skills\nWe are currently developing a career ladder for the Contributor Experience Lead. While this is worked on, we can already share the skills we are working with. But please consider some changes might still be coming. We are following a relatively ‚Äústandard‚Äù engineering career ladder framework. We consider all skills which require expertise, training, and domain knowledge to be technical skills - even if they are not engineering skills - they comprise a set of techniques that one can become an expert in.\n\nCore Competencies\n\nLeadership:¬†\nStrategic networking, Strategy development, Advocacy\n\n\nCommunication:\nOutreach, Facilitation, Engagement, Cultural Competence, Communication platforms management, Speaking & presenting, Promotion of civility, Mentoring & coaching\n\n\nHandling and Providing Feedback and Credit:\nFeedback gathering, giving, and receiving, Credit for contributors\n\n\nStrategic Alignment & Impact:\nProposal development,¬†Qualitative research, Analysis, Change management\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nCraft and Quality:\nTraining & teaching, Community events planning, Community governance support, Moderation, mediation & intervention, Emotional integration, recruitment, Management of tech platforms & CMS, Knowledge brokering, Social justice development, Hospitality techniques, Technical integration of tools, Technical writing\n\n\nDocumentation:\nContent creation and curation, Editorial, Reporting\n\nBroadly speaking, these skills require competencies in: Interpersonal skills, Communication, Culture and DEI, Program development and management, Technical skills, Qualitative research\nLike many other complex roles, we wouldn‚Äôt expect any one person to be an expert in all areas of competence, especially if they are just starting out in this role. But they should be aware that this is what the domain requires from a team of contributors, and that they would be collaborating with other folks who have a variety of skills. They might also be interested to grow and develop more broadly, or more narrowly. However, a solitary Contributor Experience Lead in a project would benefit from a brand set of skills, and a collaborative approach with fellow contributors who could help them along the way."
