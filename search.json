    "text": "Why do you want to measure your community’s health?\nThere are many reasons why you would want to measure your community health. You may want to see your community grow, be sustainable, be welcoming, have appropriate support, or become popular. You may need metrics for funding, roadmap decisions, or a more general understanding of if something is going wrong in your community or if you notice significant improvements. In any case, identifying your purpose for measuring is essential when deciding which metrics to use.\n\nFunding and reporting\nIn many cases, you want to communicate with your stakeholders in a way that demonstrates impact, achievement, or an overall assessment of the state of your community. In this situation, metrics can be helpful if combined with the story you want to tell.\n\n\nCommunicating with your community\nProjects perceived as “healthy” are more successful in attracting new contributors. The notion of health here is subjective, however, and can mean different things to different people.",

    "section": "What do you want to measure?",
    "text": "What do you want to measure?\nStart by asking, “What do we want to accomplish?” instead of asking, “What do we want to measure?”\n\nUser vs. contributor metrics\nThe first key point is whether you want to measure your user or contributor community (or maybe both!) These groups can be very different in both composition and the kind of engagement you can expect, not to mention that collecting user data may prove challenging. This also means you probably want to use different metrics for each group.\n\n\nIdentifying community-specific metrics\nEvery community is different. While we can think of a few metrics as universal, a few will tell you different stories when used in different contexts. If your goal is to assess how your project is faring compared to other projects, you must be very careful to consider projects with similar backgrounds, development workflow, scale, maturity, and audience. For example, an established project may have a lower release frequency than an up-and-coming project, and that does not mean it is unmaintained - instead, it means it is stable. In this sense, comparison can work against you.\n\n\nGrowth is not always a proxy for health.\nIt is common for “contributor growth” to be the first measure of success in any open-source community. However, growth is not always a good thing. In our experience, it has become apparent that without a plan for maintainer engagement or support, having more new contributors can be disruptive to open-source projects and create unnecessary stress on existing maintainers. Furthermore, it can create frustration on the newcomer’s part, as they need adequate support or responses on their contributions.\nIn addition, even if you are still in a project with room for growth, if you focus on the numbers alone and don’t understand how you are growing, you may end up with an unbalanced community with not enough diversity or with too many people who want to work on one part of your project, while others go unsupported.\n\n\nQualitative vs. Quantitative\nIn many cases, the answer will be a combination of qualitative and quantitative data, both of which come with their own challenges and limitations.",

    "text": "The dangers of metrics\nBecause we tend to look at the readily available metrics, there are quite a few caveats to look out for when using data to make analyses.\n\nMeasuring only what is on the code platform (e.g., GitHub)\nIt is easy to forget that community health means more than just the interactions on your code platform. Questions around credit, different contribution types, and what happens behind the scenes of an apparent one-commit contribution are challenging to handle.\nExisting tools like the AllContributors project try to capture these contributions but are, unfortunately, still unable to capture them all.\n\n\nEncouraging behavior through measuring\nWhen you decide to measure something, you create an incentive for contributors as they want to be captured in that metric. One concrete example is the green squares on GitHub and how it can encourage distortions in your community.\n\n\nConsent and data handling\nWhenever we talk about data, we must also mention the handling of this data with respect to privacy, regulatory concerns, and the consent of your community for the use of such data. While signing up to GitHub may indicate you accept that third parties can use all of its public data, you should consult with your community before making conclusions from this data.\n\n\nCan you even measure that?\nOur work focused on building culture, improving communications, inclusivity, and developing a sense of belonging. There are no easy ways to measure these goals other than using proxies. For example, we could look at survey responses, individual anecdotes, and increased contributions from people from diverse backgrounds. But these are incomplete and only tell us part of the story.",

Quite a few are focused on corporate-backed projects, as these usually require regular reporting by OSPOs or community managers, so consider whether they would apply to your community at all.\nRemember that a single metric is not capable of fully describing community health. Consider adopting a metric model - and be willing to see it change and evolve over time.\nBelow are a few models and frameworks we have found - let us know if you would like to suggest others!\n\nThe CHAOSS Project\nThe CHAOSS project collects a large number of different metrics models to be used by open-source communities and projects. Here are a few models you may want to look at:\n\nStarter project health\nProject engagement\nCommunity activity\n\nA few of these models are implemented in tools such as Bitergia, GrimoireLab and Augur.\nOrbit\nOrbit is a powerful commercial community monitoring tool that can aggregate data from many sources into one dashboard.\nYOSHI\nYOSHI is a model designed to measure the organizational status of an open-source community and, based on the previous measurements, associate a community pattern of organizational structure types matching the characteristics of the community.\nDocumentation metrics\nYou can gather many interesting insights about your users and contributors by looking at how they engage with your documentation. You can collect such data using tools such as Plausible or Google Analytics.\nProject OCEAN\nProject OCEAN is an open science collaboration focused on understanding the open source ecosystems & creating the datasets that enable research purposes and help form a clear understanding of the state of open source communities. OCEAN’s goal is to understand the health of the open source communities.\nThe TODO Group\nTODO is an open community of practitioners who aim to create and share knowledge, collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective Open Source Program Offices or similar Open Source initiatives. They also discuss metrics as part of their work.\nQualitative data\nUser surveys, post-meeting surveys, and general individual feedback can be sufficient - especially if you have a smaller community.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A roadmap is an essential document in the development of an open source project, serving as a strategic plan that outlines the mission, vision, direction, and progress of the project. Its importance can be understood through several key aspects:\n\n1. Guiding development and planning\nA roadmap provides a clear and structured plan for the project’s development. It lays out the major milestones, features, and improvements planned for future releases. This helps project leadership and contributors understand its priorities and focus their efforts on tasks that align with the project’s goals. It also aids in resource allocation, ensuring that time and effort are spent efficiently on the most impactful areas.\n\n\n2. Enhancing communication and collaboration\nOpen source projects often involve contributors from around the world. A roadmap acts as a communication tool, helping to keep everyone on the same page. It provides a shared understanding of the project’s direction, which is essential for effective collaboration. Contributors can see how their work fits into the bigger picture and how their contributions will impact future developments.\n\n\n3. Attracting and retaining contributors\nA well-defined roadmap can attract new contributors by showcasing the project’s vision, long-term goals as well as immediate needs. It demonstrates that the project is well-organized and has a clear plan for growth. For existing contributors, a roadmap helps maintain engagement by providing a sense of progress and a larger perspective.\n\n\n4. Ensuring transparency and accountability\nTransparency is a core value in the open source community. A publicly available roadmap ensures that all parties, including users, contributors, and sponsors, have visibility into the project’s plans and progress. This openness fosters trust and accountability, as the project leadership team commits to delivering specific features and improvements. It also allows the community to hold the project leadership accountable.\n\n\n5. Facilitating community feedback and involvement\nA roadmap invites feedback from the community, allowing users and contributors to suggest improvements, propose new features, and raise concerns. This feedback loop is essential for ensuring that the project evolves in a way that meets the needs of its users. By involving the community in the planning process, the project can better align with user expectations and foster a sense of ownership among contributors.\n\n\n6. Providing a framework for evaluation\nA roadmap sets benchmarks for the project’s progress, enabling regular evaluation of deliverables against set goals. This framework helps the project leadership team to measure success, identify areas for improvement, and adjust plans as needed. Regular updates to the roadmap based on evaluation results ensure that the project remains responsive to changing needs and priorities of the user community.\n\n\n7. Supporting fundraising and sponsorship\nFor many open source projects, securing funding and sponsorship is crucial for sustainability. A detailed roadmap is often a requirement in fundraising efforts, as it demonstrates a well-thought-out plan for the project’s future. Sponsors and donors are more likely to support a project that has clear goals and an action plan for achieving them."

This document will contain the agenda for the meeting, notes on what was decided/discussed, and if appropriate a record of who attended (with their internet handle attached if they are comfortable sharing!). For our new contributors meeting this is particularly important so that we can track folks who come to the meeting in our issues trackers later. Make sure you ask for consent before noting personal information in the notes if they are kept public.\nHave a public calendar listed on your website, and make sure to keep it up-to-date, particularly if you need to cancel a regular meeting.\nIf you use different communication channels, such as mailing lists, slack or other asynchronous chat/forum platform, make sure to announce the meetings there.\nMeetings tend to be more useful and productive if a basic agenda is set in advance, so that folks know what will be discussed during that time.\nIt may be useful to record the session for the benefit of those who cannot attend, or to share online with the larger community. In that case, be sure to ask for consent to record, and offer people to mute and turn off their video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMany people benefit from these meetings, but for many different reasons can’t turn on their camera or speak aloud during the meeting.

This means that you can expect a popular project to have a steady stream of contributors looking to participate.\nIf that’s not your case, you may want to invest in a few actions that will help.\n\n1. Good documentation\nWhether you are looking for code, documentation, community or any other kind of contribution, make sure your onboarding workflow is well documented and up-to-date. There are many excellent resources available online about good general documentation, including the WriteTheDocs community. If you have the resources, consider creating user stories and/or contributor journey maps to identify points of friction.\n\n\n2. Listen to your community\nThe more connected you are with your community and your user-base, the better. This can be very hard, especially if you have a broad user-base or if your community doesn’t have a way to connect with maintainers. If you have a user forum, any communication channels or social media accounts, use them as a way to understand your community needs and also how they can help you - listen to your experienced users, domain experts and other engaged community members.\n\n\n3. “Good first issues”\n\n\n\nGitHub comment on a Good First issue with the following text: Good first issue - notes for new contributors. This issue is suited to new contributors because it does not require understanding of the Matplotlib internals. To get started, please see our contributing guide. We do not assign issues. Check the Development section in the sidebar for linked pull requests (PRs). If there are none, feel free to start working on it. If there is an open PR, please collaborate on the work by reviewing it rather than duplicating it in a competing PR. If something is unclear, please reach out on any of our communication channels.\n\n\nGood first issues selected by the community are a good way to help newcomers choose tasks to work on. They should be relatively self-contained, and ideally they can be easily found by newcomers on your issue tracker (either through search, labels or your website).\n\n\n4. Sprints\nWorking sprints can be self-organized or attached to an event, such as a conference or meetup. Although they are short and often unpredictable in audience size, many people look at sprints as a way to get started with some degree of assistance from another contributor.\nSprints are a good opportunity to get people started on tasks that are not necessarily self-contained, and thus wouldn’t fit a “Good first issue” classification - but that might be tractable on a two-day sprint, with a maintainer around to answer questions.\n\n\n\nSprintable label on NumPy GitHub repositoy, described as “Issue fits the time-frame and setting of a sprint”",

If you need people to know a version control system such as Git before joining your project, make sure this is communicated clearly.

They look for actions they can take themselves, and experiences they can promote in the project as a whole. They are learners and need to adapt to the existing people and culture and build upon it.

But please consider some changes might still be coming. We are following a relatively “standard” engineering career ladder framework. We consider all skills which require expertise, training, and domain knowledge to be technical skills - even if they are not engineering skills - they comprise a set of techniques that one can become an expert in.\n\nCore Competencies\n\nLeadership: \nStrategic networking, Strategy development, Advocacy\n\n\nCommunication:\nOutreach, Facilitation, Engagement, Cultural Competence, Communication platforms management, Speaking & presenting, Promotion of civility, Mentoring & coaching\n\n\nHandling and Providing Feedback and Credit:\nFeedback gathering, giving, and receiving, Credit for contributors\n\n\nStrategic Alignment & Impact:\nProposal development, Qualitative research, Analysis, Change management\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nCraft and Quality:\nTraining & teaching, Community events planning, Community governance support, Moderation, mediation & intervention, Emotional integration, recruitment, Management of tech platforms & CMS, Knowledge brokering, Social justice development, Hospitality techniques, Technical integration of tools, Technical writing\n\n\nDocumentation:\nContent creation and curation, Editorial, Reporting\n\nBroadly speaking, these skills require competencies in: Interpersonal skills, Communication, Culture and DEI, Program development and management, Technical skills, Qualitative research\nLike many other complex roles, we wouldn’t expect any one person to be an expert in all areas of competence, especially if they are just starting out in this role. But they should be aware that this is what the domain requires from a team of contributors, and that they would be collaborating with other folks who have a variety of skills. They might also be interested to grow and develop more broadly, or more narrowly. However, a solitary Contributor Experience Lead in a project would benefit from a brand set of skills, and a collaborative approach with fellow contributors who could help them along the way.",

However, when working on large projects, there are tools you can use to make sure newcomers get the attention you need and are supported in their contributions.\nIn our projects, we chose to use GitHub Projects since the tool was already integrated into our workflow. Other tools like spreadsheets, Customer Relationship Managers (CRMs) or other community management tools could also be used. The main feature you need is a way to flag contributions by status and know which ones to follow up on.\n\n\n\nGitHub project board for first-time contributors in the Matplotlib project.

    "section": "Communication",
    "text": "Communication\nThere is some evidence that the communication between newcomers and maintainers in open-source projects does influence their decision to stay or not with the project. What looks like another patch in a sea of contributions to you may be a big deal for newcomers - especially those from underrepresented backgrounds.\nBe mindful of your communications. Use inclusive language in the documentation and in code reviews or comments. Don’t assume backgrounds or experience - newcomers are not always beginners. They may be domain experts that recently got into coding or may have vast experience in other programming languages or relevant fields of work.\nIt may be helpful to have a canned response, or a bot (such as the GitHub Welcome bot) to welcome new contributors and give them useful links, and set expectations. While some people see bots as too impersonal, a bot can be better than ignoring contributions entirely.\nHere’s an example of such a message:\n\nThank you for sending your first contribution to our project!\nIf you need help with testing, writing documentation, or getting feedback, check out our contribution guide.\nWe hope to review your contribution soon, but if you have not heard from us in a while, please feel free to contact our maintainers directly on a comment or on our communication channels.\nWe strive to be a welcoming and open project. Please follow our Code of Conduct.\n\nLikewise, following up on a successful contribution with an encouraging comment can go a long way.\n\nCongratulations on your first contribution to our project!\nIf you are motivated, feel free to look at our issue tracker and pick another item to work on - we would love to hear from you again!",

Some projects will have strict guidelines on commit messages; other projects ask that you never do a rebase; most projects require larger changes or new features to be proposed to the community before a patch is sent.\nThis information should be listed in your contribution guide, but if you can reinforce this in your interactions with newcomers, do it. These rules are probably obvious to you (the maintainer) but may not be obvious to someone from another background or another culture.\nGitHub provides Pull Request templates which can be used to provide checklists for contributors with all they need to do to get their contribution ready to be reviewed.",

    "text": "What is contributor experience?\nBehind every successful open source project is a strong contributor community. Yes, software must provide solutions. Ideally, should be a useful piece in a larger solution to a larger problem, a part of a tool-chain. However, it’s the people, the community, the culture of the community that determine the longevity of an open source project. And when we talk about the culture of any given open source community, what we really mean is the sum of:\n\nvalues, hopefully all documented as policies and guidelines,\ntechnical infrastructure\nsocial infrastructure\n\nwhich serve as ‘glue’ in onboarding and supporting contributors to an open source community.\nIn practice, for an OSS project to have a good culture means designing and providing positive contributor experience. The emerging field of open source contributor experience examines how policies, processes, and tools affect volunteer contributors’ ability to collaborate on an open source project and aims to develop best practices for creating positive contributor experience, nurturing great community culture, and ultimately supporting growth and sustainability of open source projects.",
