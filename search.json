They look for actions they can take themselves, and experiences they can promote in the project as a whole. They are learners and need to adapt to the existing people and culture and build upon it. No two projects are alike.\nIn this guide, we will elaborate about techniques for each area of activity, sharing tools, resources, and experiences. Building systems, and providing examples to motivate how those systems work in practice in different projects."

But please consider some changes might still be coming. We are following a relatively ‚Äústandard‚Äù engineering career ladder framework. We consider all skills which require expertise, training, and domain knowledge to be technical skills - even if they are not engineering skills - they comprise a set of techniques that one can become an expert in.\n\nCore Competencies\n\nLeadership:¬†\nStrategic networking, Strategy development, Advocacy\n\n\nCommunication:\nOutreach, Facilitation, Engagement, Cultural Competence, Communication platforms management, Speaking & presenting, Promotion of civility, Mentoring & coaching\n\n\nHandling and Providing Feedback and Credit:\nFeedback gathering, giving, and receiving, Credit for contributors\n\n\nStrategic Alignment & Impact:\nProposal development,¬†Qualitative research, Analysis, Change management\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nCraft and Quality:\nTraining & teaching, Community events planning, Community governance support, Moderation, mediation & intervention, Emotional integration, recruitment, Management of tech platforms & CMS, Knowledge brokering, Social justice development, Hospitality techniques, Technical integration of tools, Technical writing\n\n\nDocumentation:\nContent creation and curation, Editorial, Reporting\n\nBroadly speaking, these skills require competencies in: Interpersonal skills, Communication, Culture and DEI, Program development and management, Technical skills, Qualitative research\nLike many other complex roles, we wouldn‚Äôt expect any one person to be an expert in all areas of competence, especially if they are just starting out in this role. But they should be aware that this is what the domain requires from a team of contributors, and that they would be collaborating with other folks who have a variety of skills. They might also be interested to grow and develop more broadly, or more narrowly. However, a solitary Contributor Experience Lead in a project would benefit from a brand set of skills, and a collaborative approach with fellow contributors who could help them along the way."

    "text": "There are quite a few ways to get involved with the Contributor Experience Project. You can:\n\njoin one of our community calls\njoin our Zulip chat\nshare your ideas by filing issues, submitting pull requests, or commenting on existing discussions\naddress issues filed by other contributors\nreview submitted PRs\n\n\n\nNever made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here‚Äôs a quick rundown!\n\nFind an issue that you are interested in addressing or decide on content or feature that you would like to add.\nFork the Contributor Experience Handbook repository to your GitHub profile. This means that you will have a copy of the repository <github-username>/handbook.\nTo fork the repository, you can use the Fork button on the GitHub web interface for this repo.\nClone the repository to your local machine using:\ngit clone https://github.com/<github-username>/handbook.git\nThis means you will now have a local copy of all the contents in the GitHub repository on your computer in the handbook folder. You can rename this folder to any names you like - all the git-related information will be unchanged.\nAdd the upstream remote\nIf you want to submit pull requests and share changes to the Handbook back to the community, you need to point git to the correct repos. You can do this by setting your remote repositories.\nBy convention, we will use the name origin to point to your fork of the repository and we will call upstream the original Contributor Experience Handbook repo. To inform git, you can run the following command:\n git remote add upstream https://github.com/contributor-experience/handbook.git\nNow, if you run\ngit remote -v\nyou should see something like:\norigin  git@github.com:<github-username>/handbook.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:<github-username>/handbook.git (push)\nupstream        git@github.com:contributor-experience/handbook.git (fetch)\nupstream        git@github.com:contributor-experience/handbook.git (push)\nThis means you are all set!\n(Optional) Pull the latest changes from the main repository if you think your fork is behind:\ngit pull upstream main\nCreate a new branch and switch to it to work on your task (a selected issue, content, or feature):\ngit switch -c <branch-name>\nIt is good practice to create a new branch for each new fix/improvement your are working on. This ensures that the history of the changes to the project is well organized. You can name your branch anything - this does not interfere with the commit history.\nOnce you finished making changes to the existing code, you need to add all these changes to the staging area and commit them to the branch you are working on\ngit add <files-to-be-changed>\ngit commit -m \"<commit message>\"\nwhere <commit-message> is a brief explanation of what you did.\nPush the changes to the remote repository using:\ngit push origin <branch-name>\nSubmit a pull request to the upstream repository.\nTitle the pull request with a short description of the changes made.\nWait for the pull request to be reviewed by the project team member.\n\nCurrently, the Contributor Experience project is led by a team of three people. While only these team members have GitHub permissions to merge pull requests, we welcome pull request reviews by anyone - suggestions and comments are valuable contributions to our project.\n\nMake changes to the pull request if the reviewing team member recommends them.\nCelebrate your success after your pull request is merged!\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è\nDon‚Äôt forget to leave a star. üåü"
