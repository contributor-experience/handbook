While the role of [community manager](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/many-faces-community-manager)
is established in the open source ecosystem, the role of a Contributor Experience
lead is not yet well defined. Even though there is prior work in contributor
experience (for example, the
[Contributor Experience working group within the Kubernetes community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md)), our team has been working to develop an understanding of what this work means in
our communities. In this post, we will explain our perceptions and the
differences between contributor experience and community management.

To be clear, there is indeed a bit of overlap. Many of the activities that these
roles involve are currently not owned by anyone in particular in most
open-source projects; they are being done by overworked, overstretched
developers and maintainers who just want to see more people get involved with
their projects. That is also the case for the projects we are working on - except
for Matplotlib, none of them have a community manager role. This makes us
sometimes fill two positions, which is indeed a lot!

Due to the undefined nature of roles in most open-source projects, we often see
many different roles being shared by community members instead of concentrated
on one person. This is not necessarily bad - in fact, for small open-source
projects this may be the only reasonable way to operate. But defining
responsibilities and tasks within the project may help organize the work and
open new pathways for contributions beyond code.

## Focus on contributors

One big difference between what we think of as community managers and a
contributor experience team member is that it is common to think of the
community manager as someone that will bring new users or do promotion for the
project, raising awareness of its existence and only maybe down the line
indirectly attract new contributors. For the contributor experience team, the
focus is primarily on the contributor community, onboarding and providing better
tools and workflows for new contributors, as well as supporting maintainers in
their interactions with the contributor community. 

## The "T" word

While this work involves *a lot* of social interaction and engagement, a
contributor experience role requires reasonable _technical skills_ to help
onboard newcomers, provide tooling and automation, and
[Developer Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience#Developer_experience)
improvements to the project. These are typically not required of community
managers but are critical to the contributor experience work.

## Advocates for new contributors

If this role had *one* job, it would be to ensure new contributors are
adequately onboarded into an open-source project and that they see a clear
pathway into long-term collaboration and contribution to the community. This
could involve defining new and diverse roles in the community, documentation of
current pathways, and better workflows to support engagement in the project. But
this also involves some human connection - understanding why people want to
contribute, how they want to engage, and how we can make that experience better
for them. 

## Governance and change management

Another focus point of our contributor experience work is ensuring governance,
and internal decisions are well-documented and well-defined. This is
particularly important to create a culture of equal participation and inclusion.
This can also involve some
[change management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management) to help the
community through necessary transitions. In this sense, the contributor
experience lead has a position that is independent of maintainer status or
leadership involvement. 

## Collaboration with Community Managers

We see the Contributor Experience and Community Management areas as
complimentary; while the former focuses on contributions and internal processes,
the latter can focus on communications, outreach, social media, and program
development for the larger community. Receiving feedback and understanding what
users expect of an open-source project can also help define roadmaps and
priorities for contribution.

## What do you think?

We would love to hear from you - what do *you* think could be involved in this
work? 

We hope to create a
[community of practice](https://www.communityofpractice.ca/background/what-is-a-community-of-practice/)
around the contributor experience work and to open a more extensive discussion
about the place this work has in existing (and new) open-source projects. If you
want to talk about it, we host
[weekly community calls on Zoom](https://scientific-python.org/calendars/).
Anyone is welcome to join, chat, or just listen. Hope to see you around!
