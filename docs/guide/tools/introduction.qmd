Contributor Experience can be used to describe how a contributor perceives their
interactions with a community or project. More specifically in our case, it can
mean how much friction a new contributor faces to create a pull request, or how
the community's communication style impacts their engagement and sense of
belonging.

In this section, we'll catalogue a list of tools to address these issues. This
list is far from definitive, and we expect it to grow and change over time to
describe other kinds of interactions and new tools that become available in this
space.
