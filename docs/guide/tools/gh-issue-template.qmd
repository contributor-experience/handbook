## GitHub Issue templates

If you have your project in GitHub, you can create issue templates or forms. 
These allow you ask relevant information to contributors wanting to open a new issue to your repository. 

You can have a template for each type of issue. For example, it can be a bug report, 
a request for a new feature, or a problem in the documentation. You could also ask for more 
information.

There are two ways to add templates into your project. You can set them up directly in the 
settings of your repository, or you can create them with `YAML` format files. 

If you create the templates writing yourself the `YAML` format files, you can create them 
locally (in your machine) and push them to your repository when ready. 

The templates files should be under the directory `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` at the root of 
your project. There should be one `YAML` file for each template, if you decide to have different types. 
You also need a `config.yml` file if you want to customize the template selection.

For a step by step guide, please visit the 
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).
