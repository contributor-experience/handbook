## Our mission
The Contributor Experience Project is a community of practice dedicated to supporting, studying, 
and advancing the emerging field of open source contributor onboarding and support. Our mission 
is to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment for everyone contributing to 
open source. Through collaboration, knowledge exchange, and training, we strive to empower open 
source project leaders, community managers, and active contributors to cultivate sustainable open 
source projects and communities.

## Our values
**We are inclusive** We welcome and mentor newcomers who are making their first contribution. 
We have a [Code of Conduct](https://contributor-experience.org/docs/about/coc.html) to make 
Contributor Experience Project a welcoming place for all.

**We are community-driven** We respond to feature requests and proposals on our [issue tracker]
(https://github.com/contributor-experience/handbook/issues), making decisions that are driven by
our usersâ€™ needs.

**We are domain and language agnostic within open source**

**We value simple, readable implementations** Readable code that is easy to understand, for 
newcomers and experienced contributors alike, makes it easier to contribute new code as well as 
prevent bugs.

**We value documentation and education**
