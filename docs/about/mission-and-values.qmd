## Our mission
TBD

## Our values
**We are inclusive** We welcome and mentor newcomers who are making their first contribution. 
We have a [Code of Conduct](https://contributor-experience.org/docs/about/coc.html) to make 
Contributor Experience Project a welcoming place for all.

**We are community-driven** We respond to feature requests and proposals on our [issue tracker]
(https://github.com/contributor-experience/handbook/issues), making decisions that are driven by
our users’ needs.

**We are domain and language agnostic within open source**

**We value simple, readable implementations** Readable code that is easy to understand, for 
newcomers and experienced contributors alike, makes it easier to contribute new code as well as 
prevent bugs.

**We value documentation and education**
