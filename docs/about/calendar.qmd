We currently hold regular informal community meetings to discuss all things 
contributor experience. We are also planning on organizing more structured events 
to collaborate on documentation, host guest speakers, and highlight case studies 
from around OSSverse.  

Join us via [Zoom](https://numfocus-org.zoom.us/j/81082067424?pwd=bVNqWXhqSXZEdTl6ZzFsa1lJZ08xZz09).
Everyone is welcome to attend and contribute to a conversation.

To keep track of our community events, subscribe to the Contributor Experience Project

(*Tip:* Look for the option to add a calendar subscription from URL in your calendar app of choice.)
