# Welcome to the Contributor <br> Experience Handbook

A new open source community-led project dedicated to developing best practices for 
onboarding and supporting contributors to open source projects. 

Our goal is to provide a space to reflect, engage, and offer advancements in the 
work of effective transfer of knowledge, contributor hospitality techniques, 
project leadership, and communication infrastructure.
