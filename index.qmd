# Welcome to the Contributor <br> Experience Handbook

A new open source community-led project dedicated to developing best practices for 
onboarding and supporting contributors to open source projects. 

Our goal is to provide a space to reflect, engage, and offer advancements in the 
work of effective transfer of knowledge, contributor hospitality techniques, 
project leadership, and communication infrastructure.

To learn more and connect with peers who are working in this field, join our [contributor community 
meetings](/docs/about/calendar.html) âœ¨
