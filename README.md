# THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN ARCHIVED

We’re archiving this repository as part of sunsetting the Contributor Experience Project. 

While the project will not continue in its current form, we hope it remains a source of inspiration and guidance for those committed to building open source communities where people feel welcome, valued, and supported.

Thank you to everyone  who shared your time, insights, and ideas along the way — you’ve helped shape a better future for all in open source.

## How to build the handbook locally

The handbook is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). After you install Quarto in your local machine using the official installation instructions, you can build the html version of the handbook by navigating to the root folder of the handbook and typing

```
quarto preview .
```

The built files will be stored in `handbook-site/`.
