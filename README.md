# Contributor Experience Handbook

This handbook lives on https://contributor-experience.org

## What is this repository?

The Contributor Experience Handbook is a new open source community-led project dedicated to developing best practices for onboarding and supporting contributors to open source projects.

Our goal is to provide a space to reflect, engage, and offer advancements in the work of effective transfer of knowledge, contributor hospitality techniques, project leadership, and communication infrastructure.

## How to build the handbook locally

The handbook is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). After you install Quarto in your local machine using the official installation instructions, you can build the html version of the handbook by navigating to the root folder of the handbook and typing

The built files will be stored in `handbook-site/`.
